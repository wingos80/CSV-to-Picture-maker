As title says, currently makes an image from a csv file made up of single float value for each value square. I'll expand this to grrpah the coefficients later.
The paths you will need to change to ur computer's path, im too lazy to figure out how to make it adapt to ur computer so deal with it lul.

TO DO:
-make the thermal csv processor graph a chordwise temperature distribution, so that we can see the boundary layer behaviours more easily.
-make a .txt processor to process corr_test, cp_test, press_text.
